# Quick DM
> The dungeon master command line.

Using Quick DM, you can quickly look up monsters, roll dice, and write notes using the built-in command line to make sure your game pacing doesn't slow down.

## Commands
- `/d [dice]` - Rolls dice
  - `1d6`
  - `1d6+2`
  - `2d4+2`
- `/m [monster]` - Get a monster's abilities, stats, and actions.
  - `/m Kobold`
  - `/m Adult Blue Dragon`
- `/ms [monster]` - Get a summarised version of a monster.
- `/n [note]` - Just write a note (this is mainly for debugging, etc. but can be useful).
